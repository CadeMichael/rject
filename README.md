# R-Ject

- I was a longtime Emacs user and really miss the project management that came with **projectile.el** and **project.el**
- at the same time I was looking for a rust toy project that impliments a simple TUI
- the solution seems to be a command line project manager that allows you to store (add, remove) project paths in a local file that the program can source to present as options to the user. 
  - when the user selects a project it will `cd` them into the specified project root directory
